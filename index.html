                <p>Due to DMCA I am not able to specify too many details, so I apologize for lack of details due to this reason. The training tracker was used for me and my coworkers to learn Salesforce since we all had computer science experience, but needed to learn salesforce. This is where we used real world examples to give needed experiences. Other than working through many trailheads from the offical training site, I learned general Salesforce practices. For this project I mainly worked on flows, lightning pages and reports. I would have developed this project further but Ohio ITMS team needed my help so  I  was happy to switch to a new project. </p>

                <p>Due to DMCA I am not able to specify too many details, so I apologize for lack of details due to this reason. This project is used for users to inputing incidents, viewing current ones, answering or asking questions on these incidents. This is the current project I have been on and have been working on for 2 years and counting. I have been working more in depth with Salesforce in this project. Some techologies have been using and advancing in are permission sets, flows, LWC, lightning pages, reports, sharing settings, omniscripts, working with the data model of object relationships, and verison control and bug fix pushes via Copado. </p>
